      <p>Hi, my name is Erin! I am currently 26 years old and live in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brick,+NJ/@40.0691053,-74.1758848,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c182aa7b13512b:0x8189bef7c0280c6b!8m2!3d40.0578384!4d-74.1371832">Brick, NJ</a>. I am excited to say that I am getting married in December, so I only have a few more months of being Erin Farrell. Together me and my fianc√© have a puppy and a cat that live with us named Nymeria and  Khaleesi. In my spare time I enjoy riding my bike, going to the beach, listening to music, and watching hockey.</p>
      <p>In 2014 I graduated from <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University</a> in with a B.A in Psychology. Since then I have taken on a few different jobs, but right now I work at an after school tutoring center called <a href="https://www.mathgenie.com/">Math Genie</a>. While there I started working on developing the company's website into the site it is today. This included redesigning not only the aesthetics that the customers see, but also what the search engine sees. In doing this, I became interested in coding as a profession as well as a passion, so here I am today!</p>
      <p> I hope you enjoy the rest of the site and my <a href=portfolio.html>portfolio</a> items!</p>
